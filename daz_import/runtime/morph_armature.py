# The purpose of this file is to make morphing armatures work even if the
# daz_import add-on is not available. A typical situation might be if you send
# the blend file to an external rendering service.
#
# 1. Open this file (runtime/morph_armature.py) in a text editor window.
# 2. Enable the Text > Register checkbox.
# 3. Run the script (Run Script)
# 4. Save the blend file.
# 5. Reload the blend file.
